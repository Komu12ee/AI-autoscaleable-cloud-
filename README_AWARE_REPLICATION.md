# AWARE Replication Documentation

This document tracks the process of replicating the AWARE framework ("AWARE: Automate Workload Autoscaling with Reinforcement Learning in Production Cloud Systems") using the FIRM framework as a base.

## Environment Setup
- **Base Repo:** `https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/DEPEND/firm.git`
- **Location:** `c:/Users/komendra sahu/Dropbox/PC/Desktop/cloud-computing-research/firm`
- **Python Version:** 3.x (Environment has 3.13.5)

## Key Components to Implement
Based on the AWARE paper:

1.  **Meta-learner:** An RNN-based model to generate workload embeddings.
2.  **Bootstrapping Mechanism:** Switch between rule-based (HPA/VPA) and RL-based control.
3.  **MPA Wrapper:** Enhance the environment wrapper to support multidimensional scaling (CPU + Memory).
